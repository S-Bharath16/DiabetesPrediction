Hi There, I have Trained a Diabetes Prediction Model using Machine Learning.

NOTE:*** This Model's accuracy is 73%.
for higher accuracy, I will be updating the model later.

Also, Don't forget to change the CSV(diabetes path) to the relative path in Views.py.***

Softwares Used: Pycharm, Anaconda, python IDE.
