# Diabetes Prediction Model

Hi There,

I have trained a Diabetes Prediction Model using Machine Learning. This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various medical attributes.

**NOTE:** This model's accuracy is currently 73%. I am actively working on improving the model's performance and will be updating it for higher accuracy in future iterations.

**Important:** Please change the CSV (diabetes dataset path) to the relative path in `Views.py` to ensure the application runs correctly.

## Project Overview

The model uses various features such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, and other medical attributes to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The dataset used for training is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Ensure the path to the diabetes CSV file is correctly set in `Views.py`:
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/diabetes.csv')
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Software Used

- **PyCharm:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for writing and debugging code.
- **Anaconda:** Distribution of Python and R for scientific computing and data science.
- **Python IDE:** For running and testing the model.

## Future Work

- Improve model accuracy by experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
- Enhance data preprocessing techniques.
- Implement a web interface for easier user interaction.
- Add more visualizations for better understanding of model predictions.
